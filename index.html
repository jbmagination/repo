<h2>Dress 1.0 (DRM-Free)</h2>
<p>Due to how buggy the DRM for Dress is, I decided to take it upon myself to disable the DRM entirely. The tweak is open source, so I forked it and began working on it.</p>
<p>You can find <b>Dress 1.0 (DRM-Free)</b>'s source code <a href="alert(\"See notice below\")">here</a>.</p>
<p><i>This has now been removed from the repo by request of the original owner, Litten.</i> The tweak will still show up, but it will not be downloadable. Additionally, the GitHub repository for the Dress repo has also been removed. Please update to 1.1, which fixes the DRM issue by removing it entirely.</p>
