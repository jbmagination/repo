<h2>Dress 1.0 (DRM-Free)</h2>
<p>Due to how buggy the DRM for Dress is, I decided to take it upon myself to disable the DRM entirely. The tweak is open source, so I forked it and began working on it.</p>
<p>You can find <b>Dress 1.0 (DRM-Free)</b>'s source code <a href="javascript:alert(&#x3003;See notice below&#x3003;)">here</a>.</p>
<p><i>This has now been removed from the repo by request of the original owner, Litten.</i> Additionally, the GitHub repository for the Dress repo has also been removed. Please update to 1.1, which fixes the DRM issue by removing it entirely.</p>
